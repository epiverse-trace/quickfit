`{quickfit}` is an `R` package to help with simple model fitting tasks
in epidemiology.

`{quickfit}` is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling
of Infectious
Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases)
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the
[Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of quickfit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# check whether {pak} is installed
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/quickfit")
```

## Quick start

These examples illustrate some of the current functionalities:

``` r
library(quickfit)
```

Generate some simulated data, define a likelihood, then estimate MLE, or
MLE and 95% confidence interval based on profile likelihood:

``` r
sim_data <- rnorm(50, 4, 2)

# Define likelihood function
log_l <- function(x,a,b) dnorm(x, a, b, log = TRUE)

# Estimate MLE
estimate_mle(log_l, sim_data, n_param = 2, a_initial = 3, b_initial = 1)
#> $estimate
#>        a        b 
#> 3.945122 2.223727 
#> 
#> $log_likelihood
#> [1] -110.9108

# Estimate 95% CI based on profile likelihood
calculate_profile(
  log_l, 
  data_in = sim_data, 
  n_param = 2, 
  a_initial = 3, 
  b_initial = 1, 
  precision = 0.01
)
#> $estimate
#>        a        b 
#> 3.945122 2.223727 
#> 
#> $profile_out
#>       a1       a2       b1       b2 
#> 3.317470 4.577470 1.848473 2.749082
```

Additionally, multiple distribution models can be compared (for censored
and non-censored data).

``` r
multi_fitdist(
  data = rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 1), 
  models = c("lnorm", "gamma", "weibull"), 
  func = fitdistrplus::fitdist
)
#>    models    loglik      aic      bic
#> 1   gamma -237.0588 478.1176 483.3280
#> 2 weibull -237.7660 479.5321 484.7424
#> 3   lnorm -240.0550 484.1099 489.3203
```
