## Installation

You can install the development version of quickfit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/quickfit")
```

## Example

These examples illustrate some of the current functionalities:

``` r
library(quickfit)
```

Generate some simulated data, define a likelihood, then estimate MLE, or
MLE and 95% confidence interval based on profile likelihood:

``` r
sim_data <- rnorm(50, 4, 2)

# Define likelihood function
log_l <- function(x,a,b) dnorm(x, a, b, log = TRUE)

# Estimate MLE
estimate_MLE(log_l, sim_data, n_param = 2, a_inital = 3, b_initial = 1)

# Estimate 95% CI based on profile likelihood
calculate_profile(
  log_l, 
  data_in = sim_data, 
  n_param = 2, 
  a_initial = 3, 
  b_initial = 1, 
  precision = 0.01
)
```

Additionally, multiple distribution models can be compared (for censored
and non-censored data).

``` r
multi_fitdist(
  data = rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 1), 
  models = c("lnorm", "gamma", "weibull")
)
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that
essential features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the
package is not ready for use outside of the development team.
